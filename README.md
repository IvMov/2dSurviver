# 2D Survival Game Development Project

## About the Repository
This repository serves as a learning project documenting the step-by-step development of a 2D survival game based on a Udemy course(https://www.udemy.com/course/create-a-complete-2d-arena-survival-roguelike-game-in-godot-4/). 
The game is developed using the Godot engine with GDScript. 
Here, you'll find the complete commit history showcasing the evolution of the game code. 
Additionally, you can access the latest builds of the game, available for download and runnable on both Windows and Linux platforms.

## About the Game
The game is centered around survival gameplay, where the player must endure against constant enemy attacks for a set period. 
Featuring a level system, health management, skill upgrades, and trading mechanics, the game encompasses various aspects crucial for survival. 
From game logic to graphics and animations, every element will be meticulously implemented to create an immersive gameplay experience.
